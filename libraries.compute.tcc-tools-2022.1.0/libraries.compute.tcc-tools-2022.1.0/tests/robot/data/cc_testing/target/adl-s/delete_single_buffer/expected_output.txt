Checking the platform's current real-time configuration for maximum tolerable
buffer access latency, buffer size, etc. For more information on these
parameters see the IntelÂ® TCC Tools Developer Guide

At any time, you can press (Ctrl + C) to exit the application or press (U) to
cancel current operation and return to the main screen
********************************************************************************
Here is the initial configuration you currently have on the system

CURRENT BUFFERS ALLOCATED: 3
BUFFER 0
LATENCY(ns):        8
CACHE LEVEL:        2
CPU CORE:           2
BUFFER SIZE(bytes): 131072

BUFFER 1
LATENCY(ns):        8
CACHE LEVEL:        2
CPU CORE:           3
BUFFER SIZE(bytes): 131072

BUFFER 2
LATENCY(ns):        65
CACHE LEVEL:        3
CPU CORES:          [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]

Would you like to add (A) or delete (D) a cache allocation?

Or would you like to change the way the configuration is partitioned? (P)

Requested configuration is already applied.
To accept the current configuration, enter (Ctrl + C) to exit the application.

************************** Delete a cache allocation **************************
You will be asked which buffers you wish to delete, then be given a summary
of your requested configuration to confirm before it is applied. Or you may
return to the main menu to continue to add, delete, and edit your requested
configuration.
At any time you can press (U) to cancel current operation and return to the
main menu
********************************************************************************
Specify which of the following cache allocations you wish to delete

1. L2 core [2] (131072 bytes)
2. L2 core [3] (131072 bytes)
3. L3 core [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] (1048832 bytes)
4. Delete All

Enter the option you want to proceed with:

********************************************************************************
The following buffer will be deleted:

BUFFER 0
LATENCY(ns):        8
CACHE LEVEL:        2
CPU CORE:           2
BUFFER SIZE(bytes): 131072

A reboot is required to complete the configuration. Confirm (Y) to proceed
with this configuration. Enter (C) to continue configuring your total requested
configuration (reboot will be required later). Enter (U) to cancel the current
operation and return to the main menu.
