Requested configuration is already applied.
To accept the current configuration, enter (Ctrl + C) to exit the application.

****************************** Choose a preset ********************************
Based on your current system settings, we recommend the following preset
configurations which you can use as is or use as a template to edit from:

********************************************************************************
1. Dedicated cache for 1 real-time workload on P-core, no software SRAM
   shared cache for best-effort workloads on CPU + GPU
   for remaining P-cores and E-cores


2. Dedicated cache for 1 real-time workload on P-core, 1 x L3 software SRAM,
   shared cache for best-effort workloads on CPU + GPU
   for remaining P-cores and E-cores


3. Dedicated cache for 2 real-time workloads on P-cores, 1 x L3 software SRAM,
   shared cache for best-effort workloads on CPU + GPU
   for remaining P-cores and E-cores


4. Dedicated cache for 2 real-time workloads on P-cores, 1 x L3 software SRAM,
   2 x L2 software SRAMs (P-Core 2 and P-Core 3),
   shared cache for best-effort workloads on CPU + GPU
   for remaining P-cores and E-cores


5. Dedicated cache for 2 real-time workloads on P-cores, 1 x L3 software SRAM,
   2 x L2 software SRAMs (P-Core 2 and P-Core 3),
   dedicated but minimal GPU L3 cache,
   shared cache for best-effort workloads on CPU for remaining P-cores and E-cores


6. Dedicated cache for 1 real-time workload, 1 x L2 software SRAM on E-Core Module,
   shared cache for best-effort workloads on CPU + GPU
   for remaining P-core and E-cores


7. Dedicated cache for 2 real-time workloads, 1 x L3 software SRAM (1 way),
   1 x L2 software SRAM on P-Core 3, 1 x L2 software SRAM on E-Core Module,
   dedicated but minimal GPU L3 cache,
   shared cache for best-effort workloads on CPU
   for remaining P-core and E-cores

Applying a preset will overwrite your current configuration.
A reboot is required to complete the configuration. Confirm (Y) to proceed
with this configuration. Enter (C) to continue configuring your total requested
configuration (reboot will be required later). Enter (U) to cancel the current
operation and return to the main menu.
