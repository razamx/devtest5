Checking the platform's current real-time configuration for maximum tolerable
buffer access latency, buffer size, etc. For more information on these
parameters see the Intel® TCC Tools Developer Guide

At any time, you can press (Ctrl + C) to exit the application or press (U) to
cancel current operation and return to the main screen

Here is the initial configuration you currently have on the system

CURRENT BUFFERS ALLOCATED: 0
Would you like to add (A) a cache allocation?

Or would you like to change the way the configuration is partitioned? (P)

Requested configuration is already applied.
To accept the current configuration, enter (Ctrl + C) to exit the application.

*************************** Add a cache allocation ****************************
You will be asked a series of 4 questions to specify the type of buffer you
want to add, then a summary of your requested configuration to confirm before
it is applied.
At any time you can press (U) to cancel current operation and return to the
main menu
********************************************************************************
Do you want to specify for Latency (L) or Cache Level (C)?

Please enter the desired cache level for this buffer either L2 (2) or L3 (3):

Available cores are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
Please enter the CPU core that your real-time application will use:

Please enter the buffer size, in bytes: (estimated from 1 to 26216576 bytes):

********************************************************************************
The following buffer will be created:

BUFFER 0
LATENCY(ns):        65
CACHE LEVEL:        3
CPU CORE:           3
BUFFER SIZE(bytes): 500000

A reboot is required to complete the configuration. Confirm (Y) to proceed
with this configuration. Enter (C) to continue configuring your total requested
configuration (reboot will be required later). Enter (U) to cancel the current
operation and return to the main menu.

Here is the Requested Configuration you currently have in progress.
This Requested Configuration is not applied to the system yet.

Would you like to add (A) or delete (D) a cache allocation?

Or would you like to change the way the configuration is partitioned? (P)

A reboot is required to complete the configuration. Confirm (Y) to proceed
with this configuration.

The REQUESTED CONFIGURATION could not be set exactly as specified.
See below for the PROPOSED configuration that is closest to
satisfying your buffer request. See the Intel® TCC Developer Guide for possible reasons
why your request may have been altered: Common causes are needing to round up
the buffer size or inclusiveness.

Proposed configuration:

NEW BUFFER 0
LATENCY(ns):        65
CACHE LEVEL:        3
CPU CORE:           3
BUFFER SIZE(bytes): 1048832

NEW BUFFER 1
LATENCY(ns):        8
CACHE LEVEL:        2
CPU CORE:           0
BUFFER SIZE(bytes): 131072

A reboot is required to complete the configuration. Confirm (Y) to proceed
with this configuration. Enter (U) to cancel the current operation and return
