/**
 * @file measurement.h
 * @brief Intel(R) Time Coordinated Computing Tools (IntelÂ® TCC Tools) measurement library
 *
 * The library is intended for analysis of isochronous cyclic workloads and parts of these workloads such as data input,
 * processing, and output. An isochronous cyclic workload is a code sequence that runs multiple times (iterations), and
 * each iteration
 * must be executed within a defined period. The defined period is also known as maximum tolerable latency or deadline
 * and is the same for each iteration. Correspondingly, each part of the cyclic workload has its own deadline. The
 * maximum
 * measured latency value among all iterations is known as the worst-case execution time (WCET). The library enables
 * you to measure WCET and other latency statistics in CPU clock cycles and time units (nanoseconds or microseconds).
 * In addition, you can use the library to react on the deadline violations and/or store the latency values in a shared
 * memory
 * ring buffer to be processed by an external application.
 *
 * Key concepts:
 *
 * - Measured sequence: Code sequence that you want to analyze. It can be the whole cycle or any part of it.
 *
 * - Measured block: Block of code consisting of one or multiple iterations of the measured sequence and the
 * measurement library functions needed to measure the latency. A measured block contains tcc_measurement_start(),
 * followed by
 * the workload code, followed by tcc_measurement_end() or tcc_measurement_end_ex(). The start function uses the CPU's
 * timestamp counter (TSC) to collect the start time of the measured block. Either end function uses the TSC to collect
 * the end
 * time of the measured block, and calculates the difference between the start and end timestamps to get the latency of
 * the measured block.
 *
 * The start and end functions together add about 200 nanoseconds of latency. To reduce the relative cost of the
 * functions,
 * you can run the measured sequence multiple times within the measured block. This can be useful, for example,
 * when your data processing code contains an inner loop with multiple iterations of the measured sequence.
 * In this case, the latency of the measured block is the sum of multiple iterations of the measured sequence. The
 * library calculates
 * the latency statistics of the measured sequence by dividing the latency of the measured block by the number of
 * iterations.

/**

 * This function prevents out-of-order execution before reading TSC.
 * The function uses the LFENCE instruction:
 *   - No out-of-order (OOO) execution
 *   - Load buffers (LB) are empty after LFENCE
 *   - No deliberate restrictions on store buffers (SB), some stores may drain though
 *
 * Other options to prevent OOO are:
 *   - cpuid; affects LB and SB (both get emptied)
 *   - Forced branch miss-prediction; no effect on LB or SB but
 *     loads/stores may drain
 *
 * When the measured block has very high latency, preventing OOO
 * may not be required, and RDTSCP instruction may be enough.
