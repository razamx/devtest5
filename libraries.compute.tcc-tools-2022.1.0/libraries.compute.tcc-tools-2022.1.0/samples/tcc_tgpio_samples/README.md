# TGPIO Samples
These samples demonstrate some use-cases and advantages of Time-Aware GPIO (TGPIO). 
* The basic TGPIO samples report system information and demonstrate basic I/O.
* The main TGPIO sample demonstrates that TGPIO has lower jitter than normal software-controlled GPIO.
* The frequency discipline sample generates a signal as close to the required frequency as possible by changing Time-Aware GPIO (TGPIO) period repeatedly.
